# Unity Procedural Animation

Procedural IK Animation implemeted in Unity.

[Normal animation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_animation) uses an animation clip, which contains the transforms of the joints in chronological order.  
And these recorded animation clips are just 'played' on the bone model.  
But unlike normal one, this method uses [IK (Inverse Kinematics)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_kinematics) to procedurally position joints to interact with terrain features.
